          <h2>1. Bitcoin (BTC)</h2> <br>

          Market cap: Over $882 billion <br> <br>

          Created in 2009 by someone under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency.
          As with most cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a blockchain, or a ledger logging transactions distributed across a
          network of thousands of computers. Because additions to the distributed ledgers must be verified by solving a
          cryptographic puzzle, a process called proof of work, Bitcoin is kept secure and safe from fraudsters.

          Bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed as it’s become a household name. In May 2016, you could buy a Bitcoin for
          about $500. As of Jan. 3, 2022, a single Bitcoin’s price was over $46,000. That’s growth of about 9,200%.
        </li>
        <br> <br>
        <li>
          <h2>2. Ethereum (ETH)</h2> <br>

          Market cap: Over $447 billion <br><br>

          Both a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform, Ethereum is a favorite of program developers because of its
          potential applications, like so-called smart contracts that automatically execute when conditions are met and
          non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

          Ethereum has also experienced tremendous growth. From April 2016 to January 2022, its price went from about
          $11 to over $3,700, increasing over 33,500%.
        </li>
        <br><br>
        <li>
          <h2>3. Binance Coin (BNB)</h2> <br>

          Market cap: Over $86 billion <br> <br>

          The Binance Coin is a form of cryptocurrency that you can use to trade and pay fees on Binance, one of the
          largest crypto exchanges in the world.

          Since its launch in 2017, Binance Coin has expanded past merely facilitating trades on Binance’s exchange
          platform. Now, it can be used for trading, payment processing or even booking travel arrangements. It can also
          be traded or exchanged for other forms of cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin.

          Its price in 2017 was just $0.10; by Jan. 3, 2022, it had risen to around $520, a gain of approximately
          520,000%.
        </li>
        <br> <br>
        <li>
          <h2>4. Tether (USDT)</h2> <br>

          Market cap: Over $78 billion <br> <br>

          Unlike some other forms of cryptocurrency, Tether is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by fiat currencies like
          U.S. dollars and the Euro and hypothetically keeps a value equal to one of those denominations. In theory,
          this means Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other cryptocurrencies, and it’s favored by
          investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins.
        </li>
        <br> <br>
        <li>
          <h2>5. Solana (SOL)</h2> <br>

          Market cap: Over $52 billion <br><br>

          Developed to help power decentralized finance (DeFi) uses, decentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts,
          Solana runs on a unique hybrid proof-of-stake and proof-of-history mechanisms that help it process
          transactions quickly and securely. SOL, Solana’s native token, powers the platform.

          When it launched in 2020, SOL’s price started at $0.77. By Jan. 3, 2022, its price was around $171, a gain of
          more than 22,000%.
        </li>
        <br> <br>
        <li>
          <h2>6. Cardano (ADA)</h2> <br>

          Market cap: Over $44 billion <br> <br>

          Somewhat later to the crypto scene, Cardano is notable for its early embrace of proof-of-stake validation.
          This method expedites transaction time and decreases energy usage and environmental impact by removing the
          competitive, problem-solving aspect of transaction verification present in platforms like Bitcoin. Cardano
          also works like Ethereum to enable smart contracts and decentralized applications, which are powered by ADA,
          its native coin.

          Cardano’s ADA token has had relatively modest growth compared to other major crypto coins. In 2017, ADA’s
          price was $0.02. As of Jan. 3, 2022, its price was at $1.34. This is an increase of 6,600%.
        </li>
        <br> <br>
        <li>
          <h2>7. U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC)</h2> <br>

          Market cap: Over $42 billion <br> <br>

          Like Tether, USD Coin (USDC) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by U.S. dollars and aims for a 1 USD to 1
          USDC ratio. USDC is powered by Ethereum, and you can use USD Coin to complete global transactions.
        </li>
        <br> <br>
        <li>
          <h2>8. XRP (XRP)</h2> <br>

          Market cap: Over $39 billion <br> <br>

          Created by some of the same founders as Ripple, a digital technology and payment processing company, XRP can
          be used on that network to facilitate exchanges of different currency types, including fiat currencies and
          other major cryptocurrencies.

          At the beginning of 2017, the price of XRP was $0.006. As of Jan. 3, 2022, its price reached $0.83, equal to a
          rise of more than 13,700%.
        </li>
        <br><br>
        <li>
          <h2>9. Terra (LUNA)</h2> <br> 
  
          Market cap: Over $33 billion <br> <br>
  
          Terra is a blockchain payment platform for stablecoins that relies on keeping a balance between two types of
          cryptocurrencies. Terra-backed stablecoins, such as TerraUSD, are tied to the value of physical currencies.
          Their counterweight, Luna, powers the the Terra platform and is used to mint more Terra stablecoins.
  
          Terra stablecoins and Luna work in concert according to supply and demand: When a stablecoin’s price rises above
          its tied currency’s value, users are incentivized to burn their Luna to create more of that Terra stablecoin.
          Likewise, when its value falls compared to its base currency, this encourages users to burn their Terra
          stablecoins to mint more Luna. As adoption of the Terra platforms grows, so too does the value of Luna.
  
          From Jan. 3, 2021, when its price was $0.64, Luna has risen over 14,300% to $92.64 a year later.
        </li>
        <br><br>
        <li>
         <h2> 10. Polkadot (DOT)</h2> <br>

    Market cap: Over $29 billion <br> <br>

Cryptocurrencies may use any number of blockchains; Polkadot (and its namesake crypto) aims to integrate them by creating a cryptocurrency network that connects the various blockchains so they can work together. This integration may change how cryptocurrencies are managed and has spurred impressive growth since Polkadot’s launch in 2020.

Between September 2020 and Jan. 3, 2022, its price grew about 925%, from $2.93 to $30.04.

*Market caps and pricing current as of Jan. 3, 2022.
